That said:

1)  If you do find a bug, please let me know so I can fix it!  I can't promise that I _will_ fix it, but I don't like having my name on buggy code.

2)  Likewise, if you have a feature idea, let me know and I will _consider_ adding it.  However, be aware that I'm trying to keep this relatively simple.  Paying me to add your desired feature will go a long way, as will coding it up yourself and making a Pull Request.

3)  If you use this in some way that makes you money, I'd really appreciate a cut.  I'll leave the size up to your conscience.
